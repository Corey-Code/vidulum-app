# Purpose

This Wallet exists to provide users with a trustworthy, transparent tool for managing their cryptocurrency assets.

## Core Principles

### Open Source

All source code is publicly available for inspection. Users and developers can verify exactly what the software does, how it handles their keys, and where their data is stored.

### Peer Reviewed

The codebase is open to scrutiny from the global developer community. Security researchers, blockchain experts, and independent developers are encouraged to review, critique, and contribute to the project.

### Multi-Audited (Currently Unaudited)

Goal: Security audits from multiple independent parties ensure that vulnerabilities are identified and addressed. No single point of trust is required.

### Donations

This tool is provided at no cost. There are no premium features, subscriptions, or hidden fees. Users retain full control of their assets without financial barriers. Generous donations keep the coffee pot warm.

## Mission

To empower the people with a secure, verifiable, and accessible tool for interacting with their cryptocurrency, free from corporate influence, gatekeeping, or profit motives.

## For the People

Cryptocurrency represents financial sovereignty. The tools used to access it should embody the same principles: transparency, independence, and user control. This wallet is built by the people, for the people.
